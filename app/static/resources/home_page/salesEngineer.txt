Unknown tasks while working for a small company
<br><br>
After my internship, I received a proposal to work as a full-time 
employee in this same company. But, due to the small size the company had,
the only position I could possess is that of the 'Sales engineer'.
<br>
From that time and for two months I ran the sales department, responsible
for the creation of a network in United Kingdom (I was the
only one in this department). Sales is not my strength,
so reaching info for companies or ask for contact details from key people 
was not easy. But, I came with a tech solution which gave the
company the first client. In the end, I refused to further work in sales; 
This job was not for me.
