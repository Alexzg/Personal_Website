The main objective of the network is to help International and 
European exchange students to acquire cultural understanding 
and have self-development throughout their studies in Greece.

After alsmost two wonderful years of having contact with other
cultures and making friends throughout the globe, I had to step
back. Even today I still have contact and participate in reunion
trips.
