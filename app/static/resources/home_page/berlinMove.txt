Sometimes to go forth we have to risk and this was one of this times.
<br><br>
Trying to find out how and where is a place to change my career path, 
I found the answer to Berlin city. International and a major player in the
start-up scene, is a great place to start. So, I decided to book tickets 
and visit Berlin.
<br>
After the creation of a small network I managed to have some interviews
where I realised that I do not possess what is needed from the businesses
in Berlin. And that was great, as I finally was able to track the path
I had to follow. After working in some part-time jobs, I returned to 
Greece acquiring the tools to make the next step.
