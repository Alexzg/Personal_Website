<p>
After I finished a code challenge for an interview using Python 
(Flask), I realised how important it is to see the full picture 
of web development. 
<br><br>
Thus, I started free online courses for 'Frontend' development, 
which means HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery and React. 
<br>
Lucky me, I have many years of coding and debugging in other languages.
This website is also a part of projects I designed, as a way to 
practice and test. My next milestones are the backend libraries 
of Django and Flask.
