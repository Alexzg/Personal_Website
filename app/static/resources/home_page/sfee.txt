Industry Disruptors-Game Changers
is a non-profit/non-governmental organisation 
that was founded to promote entrepreneurship in Greece, 
South East Europe and East Med regions.
<br>
Participated in the contest 'SFEE INNOVATION PROJECT 2.0' in 2014, a 
cooperation between SFEE & ID-GC. With the research team 'DermaSense'
we managed to rank in the top 10 ideas in Greece. Though we did not 
succeed to be among the first 3 teams, which received funding and
mentorship.
