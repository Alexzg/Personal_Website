Army Service is still mandatory in Greece.
<br><br>
During my studies for the Bachelor, I was called in the army to serve as
a soldier for 9 months. However, I decided to be an officer for practical 
reasons and a difficult four month training period started. After the 
training, I joined the ranks of officers but, my total service 
time was extended to 14 months. At this time, I was also able to start 
my Thesis project for my Bachelor.

Some responsibilities I had during my service was trainer for personnel, 
weapon warehouse officer and tank platoon leader.
