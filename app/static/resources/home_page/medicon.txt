The DermaSense scanner is based on electrical impedance tomography, a promising non-invasive,
radiation-free and portable imaging technique. It is designed for
clinical and outdoor operation and the associated translational
software does not require specialized training for the operator. <br>
Initial testing results of the device are promising, suggesting it
can specifically distinguish between the presence and absence
of a nevus in the area of skin being scanned.</p>
