My Bachelor was in Automation engineering, a cross section of 
programming, electronics, electrics, design, robotics, mechanics and intellingent
systems.
<br><br>
It took me more than 4 years but, during that time I was already 
author in 2 research papers in 2 international biomedical conferences, 
4 business contests with 2 honor awards, military service done, a 
6-month internship finished and aready a full-time job.
<br>
All of them in Greece, where there are not many opportunities for
young professionals.
