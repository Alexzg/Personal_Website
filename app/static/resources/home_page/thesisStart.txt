Making an idea, reality.
<br><br>
During my military service, I contacted a professor of 
Biomedical engineering in my department with whome discussed for
a number of ideas. Then he told me that he wanted to see if it
is possible to create a device that can display to a dermatologist, a 
map of the skin of a patient.

There was no funding from the university, so the project was really 
difficult to be completed. In addition, conferences, business 
competitions and my job forced me to postpone the date of my Thesis
completion. In the end, with the great team I had, it could only be 
a success.
