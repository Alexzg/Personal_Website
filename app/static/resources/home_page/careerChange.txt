<p>
Just working in a company, is not enough for me.
<br><br>
After came to know more about the world of engineering and 
software development I decided to change my routine.
<br>
As a first step, I raised a self-funding project to supply my next steps.
Then I quitted my job, in order to deepen my understanding to new topics.
It was then, that I dediced to book tickets for a new place to test the
odds.
