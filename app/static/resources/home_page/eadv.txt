As the DermaSense research project I voluntarily work for, reached the 3rd 
phase of development, it would no longer being easily improved by the 
means possessed.
<br>
For this reason the team, basically all the doctors, a mathematician, a
biomedical engineer and myself, applied for funding from the E.A.D.V. That
was an intense period for all of us, as we had to re-design, impove, 
calculate, predict future variables and present the project in absolute
detail; Something that pushed our limits and crush-tested the team.
