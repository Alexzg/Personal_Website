Tutor for minors and teenagers
<br><br>
If you were a volunteer once, it is easy to become one again. And this 
happened in my case. For one year, I was thinking a story of a close 
friend about how he helped a child in an NGO and the child seemed happy.
<br>
After finished some projects which kept me occupied, I decided to also 
provide my skills for something better. There was a drawn in tutors 
for math and science in the NGO, so that would be for me. It is 
impossible to forget a smile from a child.
