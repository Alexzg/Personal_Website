When I started it was like someone through me in deep water 
and said, swim.
<br><br>
After some months in a manufacturing company, a gap in the Quality
Control of Mechanical parts, forced the management to re-assign that 
position to me. Although in my studies I received some basic training 
in mechanical engineering, I was not ready for such a task.
<br>
To be efficient and fast during the control, as I also had to work on 
tasks for other positions I possessed ,I developed two tools. A 
software that helped me with repetitive tasks and a QC procedure that 
mimimizes the knowledge the QC engineer needs. Both of
them could also be used even if someone had no knowledge on mechanical
engineering. So, when I was planning to quit this job, it was easier for
someone to take my place with minimum training.
