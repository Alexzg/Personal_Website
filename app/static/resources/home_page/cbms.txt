The purpose of this paper is to provide initial results from
evaluating the prototype device and to propose statistical processes which can
reveal diagnostically meaningful patterns in the data.<br>
Despite the fact that the gold standard for melanoma diagnosis remains pathologic
examination, this form of cancer has the potential to be diagnosed
through non-invasive and radiation-free techniques that are based on
electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For this reason, the aim of
this study was to design a prototype device (2nd generation)
which will be able to assist clinicians detect early stage melanoma.</p>
