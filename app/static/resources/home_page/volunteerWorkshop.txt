Social project - Workshop with science experiments for psychological
relief.
<br><br>
As a result of my knowledge in engineering and in collaboration 
with a psychologist, we created a workshop in an attempt to relief 
the psychological tension of minors (children with a difficult 
background).
<br>
The project lasted until that summer, two months in total. The scheduled 
timetable of the workshop had to be altered because of the summer and
I could not follow. Moreover, the psycologist I cooperated with had to
change department inside the NGO. To sum up, we had all the good 
intentions to change the world but, it is not always possible.
