<p>Thesis medical device - to be continued
<br><br>
After the defence for my Thesis, I thought that it would be possible to
improve the design of the medical device and of course the accompanied 
software. The new design for the device seemed promicing and the 
research team 'DermaSense' was created, in order to further improve the 
project and conduct medical pilot studies.
<br>
The team consists of Doctors, a Biomedical engineer, 
a Mathematician and myself as an R&D engineer.
