Even before university I was curius about AI.
<br><br>
At some point I decided to implement some algorithms to my own 
projects, to find out more on this topic. Python was the only choice 
and after some tutorials and guide books, it was the time to search for 
more. As a result of the low fees, I chose specializations and courses on 
'Coursera'and 'Udemy'.
<br>
Until now I finished two specializations 'Applied Data Science with 
Python' and 'Deep Learning', while I still have a course on 'Reinforcement
Learning'.
